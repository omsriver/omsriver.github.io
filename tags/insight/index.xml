          <description>&lt;p&gt;This is my journey through Om&amp;rsquo;s River.  It&amp;rsquo;s a meditation, a place to explore thoughts, questions and maybe a discover a few answers.  In the world we live today, there&amp;rsquo;s plenty to distract us.  Then finding answers is not so clear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meditation can be a way to find those answers.  But it is not the drama that we&amp;rsquo;ve made it out to be - it is a simple process to sit quietly and undistracted by the world around you, then let thoughts come, but most importantly to let them go as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Somewhere in there will be a moment of insight - may into your day, a problem that&amp;rsquo;s been plagueing you or just a deicision on what you should do next.  There are important aspects to remember though, that sometimes the answers won&amp;rsquo;t come immediately.  You&amp;rsquo;ll have to wait, I&amp;rsquo;m sorry.  Sometimes, they may not be what you thought, and deep inside a very sublte voice and feeling will tell you if it&amp;rsquo;s the right thing to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take the time.&lt;/p&gt;
